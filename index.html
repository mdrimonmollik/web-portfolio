    <h3>Professional Web Developer</h3>
    <p>I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand.</p><br>

        <h2>WORK HARD , DREAM BIG</h2>
        <h3 class="h3-class">Become World's No.1 Developer</h3>
        <p> As a young child, my dream occupation was to dig up dinosaurs. As I grew older and my interests changed, my dream profession changed also. Although most of these dreams were not very long lived, one occupational dream has outlasted all others, and has finally emerged as the dream I passionately pursue.<br>Whether we’re fighting climate change or going to space, everything is moved forward by computers, and we don’t have enough people who can code. Teaching young people to code early on can help build skills and confidence and energize the classroom with learning-by-doing opportunities.</p><br>
